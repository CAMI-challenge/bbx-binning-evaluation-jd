  - name: precision and recall for each bin
    description: >
        Report of statistics for each taxonomic bin at each taxonomic rank that was evaluated.
        Precision measures the purity of each taxonomic bin and ranges from 0 to 1 (0 to 100%).
        Recall measures the completeness of each taxonmic bin and ranges from 0 to 1 (0 to 100%).
        Bin sizes are given in absolute numbers of positions (bp).

        Report of macro-recall and truncated macro-precision at each taxonomic rank that was evaluated. [doi://10.1093/bioinformatics/btu745]
        Macro-precision measures the average purity of taxonomic bins and ranges from 0 to 1 (0 to 100%).
        Macro-recall measures the average completeness (recovery) of taxonomic bins and ranges from 0 to 1 (0 to 100%).
        Bin sizes are given in absolute numbers of positions (bp).

    description: >
        Report of macro-recall and truncated macro-precision at each taxonomic rank that was evaluated. [doi://10.1093/bioinformatics/btu745]
        Macro-precision measures the average purity of taxonomic bins and ranges from 0 to 1 (0 to 100%). The 99% cutoff means that only 99% of data (bp) in the largest bins are considered.
        Macro-recall measures the average completeness (recovery) of taxonomic bins and ranges from 0 to 1 (0 to 100%).
        Bin sizes are given in absolute numbers of positions (bp).

        Report of macro-recall and truncated macro-precision at each taxonomic rank that was evaluated. [doi://10.1093/bioinformatics/btu745]
        Macro-precision measures the average purity of taxonomic bins and ranges from 0 to 1 (0 to 100%). The 95% cutoff means that only 95% of data (bp) in the largest bins are considered.    
        Macro-recall measures the average completeness (recovery) of taxonomic bins and ranges from 0 to 1 (0 to 100%).

    description: >
        Entropy, Rand index and adjusted Rand index for each level that was evaluated.
        The entropy is in the range [0,1] and measures how heterogenous the bins are. Its best (minimum) value is 0. [doi://10.1093/bioinformatics/btm134]
        The Rand index (range [0,1]) and its normalized version, the adjusted Rand index (range [-inf,1]), are accuracy measures. Their best (maximum) value is 1. [doi://10.1038/nmeth.3103]
        Excluding not predicted sequences.
