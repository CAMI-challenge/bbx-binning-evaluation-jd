        Entropy, Rand index and adjusted Rand index for each level that was evaluated.
        The entropy is in the range [0,1] and measures how heterogenous the bins are. Its best (minimum) value is 0. [doi://10.1093/bioinformatics/btm134]
        The Rand index (range [0,1]) and its normalized version, the adjusted Rand index (range [-inf,1]), are accuracy measures. Their best (maximum) value is 1. [doi://10.1038/nmeth.3103]
